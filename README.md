# A Preliminary Survey Of Civil Society Actors
### Think of it as a 'map' that illustrates the scope and diversity of civil society at large.

**Security Without Borders** (SWB) https://securitywithoutborders.org/ describes itself as, "assisting journalists, human rights defenders, and non-profit organizations".

#### "Are you an activist, journalist, or human rights defender?"

A person looking at the website might ask themself, "I don't know, am I? I'm not Edward Snowden or Laura Poitras. I'm not a member of Amnesty and I doubt my affinity group qualifies as a NPO."

Who does SWB assist? Should distinctions be made between journalists and writers for example, or between NPO's and community organizations?

To explore these questions, lets use the encompassing term 'civil society' to describe the four actors mentioned above and then look at who else falls under the same umbrella.

Below is a comprehensive survey of civil society actors. It lists and describes 'types' (or categories) of actors, offers a recognizable example of each and links to more comprehensive lists of individuals.

It does not necessarily identify 'cyber security' actors nor does it attempt to identify individuals 'at risk'. Think of it simply as a 'map' that illustrates the scope and diversity of civil society beyond the examples given on the SWB website.

It is intended to help SWB to identify the broad range of people who may or may not require assistance and may also be used by individuals to recognize themselves as qualifying for SWB's assistance.

Some observations:

1. Within any type, there are actors across the spectrum (e.g. both pro-choice and pro-life activists believe they are fighting injustices).

2. The diversity of actors within each type is as broad as across types (e.g. animal rights activists may have more affinity with fair trade farming co-ops than disability rights activists).

3. Many actors can be categorized as multiple types (e.g. Amnesty International is a charity, NGO and a human rights organization).

##Human Rights Organisations

International non-governmental human rights organizations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, International Service for Human Rights and FIDH monitor what they see as human rights issues around the world and promote their views on the subject.

Human rights organizations frequently engage in lobbying and advocacy in an effort to convince the United Nations, supranational bodies and national governments to adopt their policies on human rights. Many human-rights organizations have observer status at the various UN bodies tasked with protecting human rights.

##Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs)

A nonprofit organization (NPO) (also known as a non-business entity) is an organization with the purpose of which is something other than making a profit. A nonprofit organization is often dedicated to furthering a particular social cause or advocating for a particular point of view. In economic terms, a nonprofit organization uses its surplus revenues to further achieve its purpose or mission, rather than distributing its surplus income to the organization's shareholders (or equivalents) as profit or dividends. This is known as the non-distribution constraint. The decision to adopt a nonprofit legal structure is one that will often have taxation implications, particularly where the nonprofit seeks income tax exemption, charitable status and so on.

##Social Justice Organizations

Social justice is the fair and just relation between the individual and society. This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of wealth, opportunities for personal activity and social privileges. In Western as well as in older Asian cultures, the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal roles and receive what was their due from society. In the current global grassroots movements for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation of safety nets and economic justice.

##Women's Rights Organizations

Women's rights are the rights and entitlements claimed for women and girls of many societies worldwide, and formed the basis to the women's rights movement in the nineteenth century and feminist movement during the 20th century. In some countries, these rights are institutionalized or supported by law, local custom, and behavior, whereas in others they may be ignored or suppressed. They differ from broader notions of human rights through claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls, in favour of men and boys.
