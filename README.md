# A Preliminary Survey Of Civil Society Actors
## Think of it as a 'map' that illustrates the scope and diversity of civil society at large.

Security Without Borders (SWB) https://securitywithoutborders.org/ describes itself as, "assisting journalists, human rights defenders, and non-profit organizations".

### "Are you an activist, journalist, or human rights defender?"

A person looking at the website might ask themself, "I don't know, am I? I'm not Edward Snowden or Laura Poitras. I'm not a member of Amnesty and I doubt my affinity group qualifies as a NPO."

Who does SWB assist? Should distinctions be made between journalists and writers for example, or between NPO's and community organizations?

To explore these questions, lets use the encompassing term 'civil society' to describe the four actors mentioned above and then look at who else falls under the same umbrella.

Below is a comprehensive survey of civil society actors. It lists and describes 'types' (or categories) of actors, offers a recognizable example of each and links to more comprehensive lists of individuals.

It does not necessarily identify 'cyber security' actors nor does it attempt to identify individuals 'at risk'. Think of it simply as a 'map' that illustrates the scope and diversity of civil society beyond the examples given on the SWB website.

It is intended to help SWB to identify the broad range of people who may or may not require assistance and may also be used by individuals to recognize themselves as qualifying for SWB's assistance.

Some observations:

1. Within any type, there are actors across the spectrum (e.g. both pro-choice and pro-life activists believe they are fighting injustices).

2. The diversity of actors within each type is as broad as across types (e.g. animal rights activists may have more affinity with fair trade farming co-ops than disability rights activists).
