# A Preliminary Survey Of Civil Society Actors
## Think of it as a 'map' that illustrates the scope and diversity of civil society at large.

Security Without Borders (SWB) https://securitywithoutborders.org/ describes itself as, "assisting journalists, human rights defenders, and non-profit organizations".

### "Are you an activist, journalist, or human rights defender?"

A person looking at the website might ask themself, "I don't know, am I? I'm not Edward Snowden or Laura Poitras. I'm not a member of Amnesty and I doubt my affinity group qualifies as a NPO."

So who does SWB support? Should distinctions be made between journalists and writers for example, or between NPO's and community organizations?

To explore these questions, lets use the encompassing term 'civil society' to describe the four actors mentioned above and then look at who else falls under the same umbrella.

Below is a comprehensive survey of sivil society sctors. It lists and describes each type of actors, offers a recognisable example of each and links to more comprehensive lists of individuals.

It does not necessarily identify cyber security actors or groups at risk. Think of it simply as a 'map' that illustrates the scope and diversity of civil society beyond the examples given.

Some observations:

1. Within any type, there are individuals across the spectrum (e.g. both pro-choice and pro-life activists believe they are fighting injustices)

2. The diversity of individuals within each type is as broad as across types (e.g. animal rights activists may have more affinity with fair trade farming co-ops than disability rights activists)
